# scale factor of image inputs - to speed up processing
# and increase accuracy, the larger the table on the image
# the smaller this value can be
# for an almost full covered image a value of 0.25 is good
# for tables covering less 0.5 yields good results

preview: True

# these set hard bounds on some of the template matching methods
# for example it limits rotation over certain angles
# as those would be unrealistic (given a good data
# acquisition protocol)
features:
  max_features: 25000 # maximum number of features to generate
  good_match: 0.5 # fraction of good matches to consider

fft:
 rotation_tolerance: 10 # only allow rotations of 10 degrees or less
 translation_tolerance: 1000 # only allow translations X/Y of 500px or less
 scale_tolerance: 3
